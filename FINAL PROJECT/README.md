CPE329 final project:
Utilizing X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 expansion board to read accelerometer data via I2C, installed drivers to read accelerometer data. 
Sending data to elevator correction angles to servos using PWM control. Elevator control used to correct in flight pitch 
and roll angles, found by accelerator data.
